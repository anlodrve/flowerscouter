# Flower Scouter

## Description

_Duration: Two week sprint_

Flower Scouter is a social media mobile application that allows users to map flowers they see out in the world and share them with their community. Users can see spots that have been added by all registered users and add their own spots to the map too. The map centers on the user's current location, making it easy to simply click to add a marker to the map. Users can see what other people are saying about different spots, and like and comment on those spots as well. Users can also view their own spots on their User Page in a map or list view, and edit and delete their spots as well.
