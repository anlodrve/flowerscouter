# Flower Scouter

## Description

_Duration: Two week sprint_

Flower Scouter is a social media mobile application that allows users to map flowers they see out in the world and share them with their community. Users can see spots that have been added by all registered users and add their own spots to the map too. The map centers on the user's current location, making it easy to simply click to add a marker to the map. Users can see what other people are saying about different spots, and like and comment on those spots as well. Users can also view their own spots on their User Page in a map or list view, and edit and delete their spots as well. 

For this project, I used the Google Maps API with a React package: @react-google-maps/api. I looked into many different options for integrating Google Maps, and found this package to be more usable and effective for my goal of creating and viewing markers and info windows. With the currently available documentation, this was still quite challenging to figure out due to the React v.18 update and I hope to add to documentation for this in the future. 

Goals for future work include image upload, sorting the map by type of flower, and a feature that notifies users when flowers are in bloom.

In the Add a Spot page, the map loads on the user's current location. The user can click to add a spot to the map, as well as a flower category and a description to help other users see it.

After submitting a spot, users can see it on the Home Page on the map, or in the List View. In the List View, users can view comments by other users on spots and add their own comments. Users can also like spots.
